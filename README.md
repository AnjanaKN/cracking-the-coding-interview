Instructions
============

Each solution in this repository is self-contained. Each directory contains
the solution to a given problem and tests to check its correctness (most of
the tests are randomized). To run the tests for a given problem on Linux,
enter the associated directory for that solution and compile it first:

	make

The tests can then be executed by running:

	./solve
